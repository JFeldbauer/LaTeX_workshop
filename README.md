# A short intro to LaTeX course

This is material for a short introduction workshop to LaTeX. It is mainly based upon ["The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeXe" by Tobias Oetiker, Hubert Partl, Irene Hyna and Elisabeth Schlegl](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf). If you have any recommendations or remarks feel free to contact me.
